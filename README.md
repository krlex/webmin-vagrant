# The Webmin in Vagrant

Webmin is a web-based system configuration tool for Unix-like systems,
although recent versions can also be installed and run on Microsoft Windows.
Webmin allows the user to configure operating system internals, such as users, 
disk quotas, services or configuration files, as well as modify and control 
open-source apps, such as the Apache HTTP Server, PHP or MySQL.

```
vagrant up

```
vagrant provision
```
